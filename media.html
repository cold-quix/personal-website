								<div class="videos_two_first videos_content videos_title">Guilty Gear Xrd Rev2 Character Overview</div>
								<div class="videos_two_second videos_content videos_desc">A video I created as an introduction to the video game Guilty Gear Xrd, a fighting game with 25 unique playable characters. New players can feel overwhelmed, so I wanted to describe each character in one minute to highlight their strengths.<br><br>All the characters in GGXrd is very complex, so describing them while still leaving time for an intro card and ending summary was not easy.  I really had to cut to the core of the character and not waste time.<br><br>This video reached 165,000 views, which is impressive considering I had zero traction when I published it.</div>

							<div class="videos_four">
								<div class="videos_four_first videos_content videos_title">Balance History - Guilty Gear Xrd Raven</div>
								<div class="videos_four_second videos_content videos_desc">A video describing the history of changes and balance patches for the character Raven in Guilty Gear Xrd. I like Raven a lot, but when he was first added to the game he was far too strong for competitive balance.<br><br>This video reached 50,000 views.</div>

							<div class="videos_six">
								<div class="videos_six_first videos_content videos_title">Spoke - Winterfest 2015</div>
								<div class="videos_six_second videos_content videos_desc">A news story I wrote, filmed, and edited covering a neighbourhood sledding party in Kitchener. A simple, feel-good story about families going sledding.<br><br>One of my better videos from my time studying journalism at Conestoga.</div>

							<div class="videos_eight">
								<div class="videos_eight_first videos_content videos_title">Spoke - Gaming Cafe Spotlight</div>
								<div class="videos_eight_second videos_content videos_desc">A news story I wrote, filmed, and edited covering tabletop gaming cafes in Kitchener and Waterloo.<br><br>This story was created in 2015, just before the board game explosion of 2016 began. It's a neat snapshot of one city's fledgling industry.</div>

								<div class="videos_ten_second videos_content videos_desc">A series of videos I recorded for Dan Glenn-Graham's election campaign in 2014. Some of my earliest work, but still professional and meaningful.</div>

							<div class="other_one other_content"><a href="../resources/ZoomGuidePublic.pdf">A Simple Guide to Joining a Zoom Meeting</a></div>
							<div class="other_two other_desc">A guide I wrote for my elderly great aunt to help her join Zoom meetings. Very simple and very plain, but still a good example of technical writing.<p>There were quite a few restrictions for this project due to my aunt's poor grasp of technology, which I realized when I interviewed her to learn exactly what she needed help with.</p><p>She doesn't understand normal words for website navigation, so I couldn't use terms like "submenu" or "interface," which most people would consider common.  We could not change anything within the Zoom application itself on her iPad, since she just doesn't know how to navigte it.</p><p>For instance, there is an option within Zoom to disable video before joining a meeting - exactly what she wants, but I couldn't describe it because she couldn't navigate the Zoom application itself.  Essentially, I had only the most basic words to describe only the most basic actions and use only the most basic menus.  It was a real challenge.</p></div>
